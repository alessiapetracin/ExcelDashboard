# ExcelDashboard
This project aims to create an interactive dashboard, describing sales and profits for a retail store.
The dashboard leverages on data from multiple sheets, namely *Sales-2016*, *Sales-2017*, *Sales-2018* and *Sales-2019*, reporting sales for each year in the 2016-2019 time-period. Using Slicers, users can easily filter and analyze the data, gaining insights into sales and profit performance for each product by city, country and time-period.

### Usage
To use the Excel dashboard, simply open the provided Excel file and interact with the Slicers to filter data as needed. The dashboard will automatically update based on the selected filters, providing real-time insights into different aspects of the business. Caveat: since country and city can be mutually exclusive, remember to remove the filtering from one of the two before interacting with the other Slicer.

### Data
The raw data on which the Dashboard is built on is found on files *Sales-2016*, *Sales-2017*, *Sales-2018* and *Sales-2019*, which can be downloaded to take a look at it.
